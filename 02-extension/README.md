# Beyond Poverty: Measuring Quality of Life from Satellite Images
Previous work has shown that asset wealth and consumption expenditure (recognised indicators of poverty) can be estimated from satellite images.

**Question**: Can other socioeconomic indicators be estimated from satellite images that represent a more holistic picture of quality of life?
