# Beyond Poverty: Measuring Quality of Life from Satellite Images in South Africa
Previous work has shown that asset wealth and consumption expenditure (recognised indicators of poverty) can be estimated from satellite images.

**Question**: Does local work in [Gauteng](../02-gauteng) generalise to South Africa?

## Data Retrieval
- **General Household Surveys South Africa**
  - Download GHS dataset for 2021 from [Data First](https://www.datafirst.uct.ac.za/dataportal/index.php/catalog/905) portal.
  - Unzip folder
  - Rename the household DTA file to `ghs-2021.dta`
  - Copy DTA file to the [data](data) directory

Your data directory should now look like:
```
data
  ghs-2021.dta
```
